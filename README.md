# SnowMusic
Music Player for Android

Snow Music is a music player for Android. This was a project of mine that I worked on in 2015-2016. I do not recommend using this code as any type of reference.

The idea behind Snow Music is a fully customizable and themeable music player. With a wide variety of themeable views and widgets, almost every aspect of the app can be themed.

Other features:
- Custom Tagging
- Auto-download Album Art
- Meta-tag editing
- Chromecast support
